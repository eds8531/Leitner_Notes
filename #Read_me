This is a flashcard program designed to help students learn vocabulary in their long term memory. Right now, it's formatted as a program that reads notes and produces flashcards, but it could easily be preloaded with words for students to learn. 
To use the program right now the user must first open a .txt file and then take notes in the following format:

@ Subject 1 # All terms following this line will be labelled subject 1 until another '@' symbol is called at the beginning of a line.

! Term 1 -- Definition 1

!Term 2 -- Definition 2

etc...
